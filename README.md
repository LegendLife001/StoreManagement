To run this program you will need to keep all the files of the "additionals" and "database" folder.
the database folder contains the saved databases (you can also export database here using this program's GUI(in stock_review section)
and the additionals folder contains the values, images and the invoice bills.
hence the the program won't run without the additionals folder

> after logining in, boom! you are in the main window, you can act on any action you want to perform.
